Privacy and Policy Statement for “MakeUp Quiz”

Effective Date: Decemberr 30, 2025

1. Overview

“MakeUp Quiz” is a no-subscription, offline, in-classroom quiz management application designed to promote honesty, integrity, and fairness during quizzes and tests. It enables teachers to create, manage, and administer paperless quizzes even in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.

The app uses Bluetooth, Wi-Fi (Nearby Devices), and Location Discovery technologies solely for secure offline sharing and synchronization of quiz data between teacher and student devices.

“MakeUp Quiz” is a FREE application supported by advertisements. We may use third-party advertising providers, such as Google AdMob, to display ads within the app. These third-party partners may collect limited, non-personal data such as:

    * Device information (e.g., model, operating system)
    * General location (e.g., city-level)
    * Advertising ID (used for ad personalization and analytics)

These data are handled according to the respective third party’s privacy policies and are not stored or controlled by MakeUp Quiz.
